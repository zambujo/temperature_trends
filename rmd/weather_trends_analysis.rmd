## Introduction

In this project, we want to compare local versus global weather trends.  My current location is Switzerland.  Inspection of the `city_list` table of the SQL database shows that weather data for Switzerland is available for the city of Bern.

```{sql citycheck, eval=FALSE}
select city
from city_list
where country = 'Switzerland'
```


## SQL data download

```{sql download, eval=FALSE}
select 
city,
country,
city_data.year, 
city_data.avg_temp as local_average_temperature,
global_data.avg_temp as global_average_temperature
from city_data
full outer join global_data on city_data.year = global_data.year
where country = 'Switzerland' and city = 'Bern'
```

## Showing weather trends

### Using Python to read the weather data

```{python loading}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
city_data = pd.read_csv("../data/average_temperature_trends.csv")
# global_data = pd.read_
city_data.info()
```
